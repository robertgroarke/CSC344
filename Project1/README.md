This program is an adaptation of  Ed Foley's SoundSplicer program,
which uses Dr. Andrew Greensted's Java Wav File IO library.

Wav Rearrange rearranges the file Grand_Theft_Ecstasy.wav and 
outputs the file New_Grand_Theft_Ecstasy.wav. 

The outputted file is a 30 second clip of the beginning of the
song. The frames are reversed, and the clip is split in half and
the two parts are swapped.
