CSC344 - Final Project
======================

This program is an extension of project 4. Project 4 was a subset based algorithmic composition
program in which there were different probabilities at certain times that a measure, half measure
or quarter measure would be repeated. In addition to project 4's functionality, this program also 
merges two songs, and switches between them intermittently at randomized intervals.
While switching between the two songs there is a randomized period of time in
which one song is played in the left channel while the other is played in the right. This program
takes in two songs, Boten Anna and Dota by Basshunter. These songs were chosen for a couple reasons.
First off, Basshunter produces  relatively simplistic electronic music which in my opinion all sounds
very similar to begin with. Secondly, both songs are at 140 beats per minute and are in the key A minor.
These songs were chosen in an attempt to have the best sounding output after merging them.
At this point the output sounds kind of like a jumbled mess and not too much like real music, but honestly
I think it sounds pretty decent considering it is a merging of two songs done by a randomized program.
